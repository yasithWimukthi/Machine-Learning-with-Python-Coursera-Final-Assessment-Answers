Create ML models using :  1.  Linear Regression 2.  KNN 3.  Decision Trees 4.  Logistic Regression 5.  SVM

## Project Scenario

For your project, you will use a rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms to the data. Alternatively, you can download your data from 
here
. 

You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
